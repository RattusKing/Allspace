## 📝 Code Style

### Python (Backend)
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular

### JavaScript (Frontend)
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Follow existing formatting
- Use descriptive variable names

### General
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Add comments for non-obvious code
- Update README if adding new features

## 🎯 Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled `good first issue` - these are perfect for newcomers!

Ideas for contributions:
- Improve error messages
- Add more example images
- Enhance documentation
- Optimize performance
- Improve wall / door / window detection
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add unit tests

## 🧪 Testing

Before submitting a PR:
1. Test the backend API endpoints
2. Test the frontend UI flow
3. Test with various image types and sizes
4. Verify exports work in Unity/Unreal/Blender
5. Check for memory leaks with large images

## 📚 Documentation

Good documentation is just as important as code:
- Update README.md for new features
- Add inline code comments
- Update API documentation
- Create examples for new functionality

## 🔍 Review Process

1. Automated checks will run on your PR
2. Maintainers will review your code
3. Address any requested changes
4. Once approved, your PR will be merged!

## 💡 Ideas for Major Contributions

- More robust wall detection (line/centerline geometry, support for multiple drawing styles, colors, and DPIs)
- Distinguish non-wall symbols (text, dimensions, furniture, door swings) from walls
- Derive real scale automatically from a drawing's scale bar or dimension annotations
- Better door/window detection from drawn symbols (instead of pixel brightness)
- Real FBX export (needs an external converter — the app currently exports GLB + OBJ)
- Advanced mesh optimization
- Batch processing
- Unity/Unreal plugins
- Mobile app

## ❓ Questions?

Feel free to:
- Open a discussion in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/yourusername/image-to-3d-generator/discussions)
